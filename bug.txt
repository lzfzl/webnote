1. httphandler.cpp:line64:
    try to search \t in text, ignoring ' ', "\t"->" \t".
2. if(!strcmp(m_method,"GET")&&!strcmp(m_method,"PUT"))
    when it comes to char* string, != == while compare their address,but for std::string, we can use != ==
3. clientfd is 0
    webserver.cpp:120 if(fd!=conn[fd].m_clifd)continue;
    frequent requests make the epoll event list still keeps the closed connection info,remove it. 
4. webbench can`t  receive any bytes:
    using a small MAX_CONNECT_NUMBER(4),change it to 100
5. deal with Bug in doubly linked list insertion
6. struct problems
    httphander cannot access timer,so how can it destory its timer?
    : when a new connection arrives, destory meaningless node first.
7.  server cannot receive post requests:
    server doesnt deal with options requests
8. 代码一直在解析请求头处循环
    只处理了部分参数(connection:etc.)，没有处理除此之外的任何参数，导致文本解析原地踏步
